This repository provides a unofficial Python wrapper to use [navitia.io APIs](https://doc.navitia.io).

##  Pre-requisites

To use this library, you will need an access token from [navitia.io](https://navitia.io/tarifs/).

##  Installation

The package is available on PiPy

```bash
pip install python-navitia-client
```

##  API support

The library supports the following [APIs](https://doc.navitia.io/#api-catalog):

## Usage

To use this library, you need an authentication token provided by Navitia.io.

### Create client instance

Once created, you will create an instance of the NavitiaClient class with the following:

```python
from navitia_client.client import NavitiaClient
client = NavitiaClient(auth=<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>)
```

A base URL for Navitia IO is hardcoded and provided to NavitiaClient by default. It can be updated using the base_navitia_url parameter.

###  Access APIs data

URLs are mapped as property in the class `NavitiaClient`. You can find the mapping [here](docs/api_support/).

For example, if you want to have the list of datasets in a given region, use:

```python
datasets, pagination = client.datasets.list_datasets(region_id=<REGION_ID>)
```

### Pagination

A couple of APIs are paginated, in particular the public transporations APIs.. In such case, you can navigate in the response using the parameters `start_page` and `count`.

An object `Pagination` will be provided by the impacted methods to help you navigating.

### Tips

Few tips on how to use the Navitia APIs are available [here](docs/few_tips.md).

##  Additional questions

* Are you affiliated with Navitia ?
No. This is an unofficial wrapper for the Navitia.io APIs.

* Is this client asynchronous ?
No, and it is not planned to. If you want to add async support, feel free to contribute.

* Is this client production ready ?
Yes and no. For my own purpose, it is, but I cannot guarantee that everything will behave well. If you spot a bug, please open an issue in the repo.
